AI-powered accident detection system using CCTV video analysis and low-cost sensor network on light poles.  
Built as a student founder project to make roads safer and smarter.

## 📌 What it does
- Detects vehicle accidents in real time from existing CCTV feeds using AI
- Adds low-cost sound & vibration sensors on light poles to cover blind spots
- Alerts nearby police stations and hospitals through a web dashboard

## 🛠 Tech stack
- Computer Vision: OpenCV + TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Backend: (your choice – Node.js / FastAPI / Java Spring Boot)
- Hardware: ESP32, vibration/sound sensors, mini camera
- Cloud: AWS / GCP / Azure (student credits)

## 📍 Vision
Create a scalable, affordable accident detection and emergency response system for every city.

> Currently under active development as my final year capstone and startup MVP.
